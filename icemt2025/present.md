### Complex Systems Concepts and Definitions

| Complex systems concepts | Definitions |
|---|---|
| **element** | Agents or components constituting complex systems |
| **action** | Actions demonstrated by agents or components |
| **relation** | The relation between different agents or components |
| **boundary** | The boundary of complex systems |
| **adaptation** | Complex systems can manage or adapt to the disruptions of conditions |
| **feedback loops** | A process in which the output of a system influences its own operation or behavior |
| **interaction** | Multiple relationships between various agents or components |
| **iteration** | Processes within complex systems can happen iteratively |
| **randomness** | There are chance factors that make the complex systems unpredictable |
| **self-organization** | A spontaneous mechanism results from the interactions, which gives rise to various emergent patterns |
| **decentralized order** | No central controller in complex systems |
| **dynamic process** | Complex systems are dynamic and ongoing rather than static |
| **emergence** | The phenomenon where novel patterns emerged from the interactions or self-organization |
| **equilibrium** | A stable state results from different systems mechanisms |
| **multiple levels** | Complex systems can be considered as a combination of systems structures, mechanisms, and phenomena |
| **nonlinear effect** | The effects of systems may not be proportional |

- **Student collaboration:**  
  Benefited from shared artifacts and representations  
  Which aspects of complex systems?

- **Computer simulations**  
  Benefited from visibility and hands-on experiences  
  Mixed results in previous studies

- **Conceptual scaffolding**  
  Bridging prior knowledge and providing new information  
  Limited effect of common text-based scaffolding

This collaborative process enriched their knowledge base, helping them identify a broader array of possible elements, actions, and interactions.

## Page 13: Result - Interview for Computer Simulation

*[示意圖]*

Our data suggested that computer simulations had a limited impact on promoting the understanding of emergent concepts, whereas their effectiveness increased when conceptual scaffolding was provided.

## Page 14: Result - Interview for KM Scaffolding

By following the sequential guidance provided by cross-referenced figures. In KM scaffolding, Sophia was able to identify more relationships and mechanisms.

They might annotate the relationship between two elements as 'balance' but fail to explain how the interactions among these elements contribute to such a phenomenon.

Lily's case illustrates this issue. She indicated that processing textual information was already challenging, making it even more difficult to articulate and incorporate these ideas into her concept maps.

## Page 15: Discussion and Conclusion

### Student Collaboration
**Quantitative:** enabling students to identify key elements and relationships within complex systems.  
**Qualitative:** reinforcing the exchange of diverse perspectives, thereby enriching students' knowledge base.

### Computer Simulations
**Quantitative:** enabling students to identify key elements and relationships within complex systems.  
**Qualitative:** once students understand emergent concepts, visualization helps solidify their comprehension.

### Conceptual Scaffolding (KM vs. OT)
**Quantitative:** KM shows greater improvement in elements, interactions, feedback loops, and decentralized order.  
**Qualitative:** explicit features such as cross-referenced figures and sequential guidance do help.
