## Page 1: A stellar metaphor: Forging the research trajectory

When I think about complex systems thinking, I am reminded of a dense nebula in space. At the core of this nebula lies complex systems thinking, my research focus that binds everything together. Surrounding this core are diffuse elements, including science education theories, learning technologies, and instructional practices. They form the interstellar medium, providing the context and abundant materials for new insights, much like the conditions necessary for star formation.

To construct a star system (my research program), I must first introduce a gravitational force to draw scattered elements together, consolidate their contributions, ignite them into something luminous. My first study, a systematic review, serves as this initial gravity. It pulls diverse findings from the literature into a coherent framework, forming a protostar.

However, a protostar cannot achieve fusion without immense pressure. My second study provides this pressure through empirical validation. During this compression, my initial understanding may be incomplete or imprecise. Recognizing these limitations does not render the work meaningless; rather, it indicates where refinement is needed. This process elicits my research tenet: I must first understand my current reality before I can transcend it to create new value.

Once fusion ignites (my research findings achieve coherence), I can look outward to explore how my newly formed star interacts with other celestial bodies. My third study, therefore, explores how complex systems thinking interacts with students' scientific inquiry. It examines whether and how these two "bodies" can illuminate and strengthen each other.

**Computer simulation-based learning (CoSBL) environments for complex systems: a systematic review**

We reviewed 50 papers involving 55 simulations, synthesizing complex systems concepts, simulation types, and pedagogical design features of computer simulation-based learning (CoSBL) environments for complex systems.

**Scaffolding Complex Systems Thinking: A Comparative Study of Knowledge Maps and Ontological Supporting**

We compared knowledge maps scaffolding (KM) and Ontological scaffolding (OT) effectiveness in a three-week course with 175 eleventh-grade students. Linear mixed models and follow-up interviews were employed to analyze learning outcomes.

**Scientific inquiry and complex systems thinking**

My research purpose is to investigate the interplay between complex systems thinking and students' scientific inquiry throughout the entire inquiry process. By doing so, I aim to provide empirical evidence about how complex systems thinking shapes students reasoning and decision-making at different inquiry phases, including both productive patterns and persistent challenges in students' engagement with this approach.

## Page 12: Research plan: Participants

This study involved 105 students in the 11th grade students (aged 16-17) from a senior high school in Taiwan. The participants were drawn from four randomly selected classes within the same school. To ensure all participants possessed basic complex systems thinking, students first completed a three-week complex systems thinking program. Following this preparation, they participated in an eight-week scientific inquiry unit, which was taught by the same teachers. The instructional sessions took place in a laboratory during their respective class periods.

## Page 14: Research plan: Data

Students from the two inquiry conditions were further divided into twelve groups (six from each condition), with four to five students in each. During the eight-week inquiry unit, students were asked to self-record their weekly group discussion and transcribed them into transcripts, which served as the primary data for our study.

## Page 17: Research plan: ENA

I plan to analyze students' group discussion transcripts using Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). ENA can model patterns of association among elements in a network over time (Shaffer et al., 2016). It has been increasingly used to explore students' conceptual structure (Chang & Tsai, 2023) and the co-occurrence of learning behaviors with cognitive processes (Huang et al., 2023). ENA is therefore well-suited to our goal of investigating the interplay between students' scientific inquiry and their complex systems thinking. Moreover, its affordance for network comparison will allow me to compare the differences between different inquiry conditions. I will use the ENA Web Tool to analyze the coded data (https://www.epistemicnetwork.org/).
